Using Mall Customer Dataset and performing K-Means clustering to segregate customers based on the data in form of optimal clusters.
## PROCESS:
1. Understanding the data.
2. Perform Elbow method to find Optimal No. of clusters.
3. Training a model using unsupervised learning algorithm(K-means)
4. Plotting the Clusters.

## CONCLUSIONS
* customers in Cyan Cluster are the customers having less Annual Income and more spending.
* customers in Red Cluster are the customers having less Annual Income and more spending.
* customers in blue Cluster are the customers having decent Annual Income and decent spending.

*Hence we can say company should target the blue cluster and promote their products to blue cluster customer to get better sales.*
